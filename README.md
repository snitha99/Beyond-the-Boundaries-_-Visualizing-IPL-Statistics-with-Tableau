# Project Objective
 The project aims to create an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides a deep dive into IPL statistics across multiple dimensions, including:

**Match Statistics:** Toss outcomes, biggest wins, and highest totals.
**Player Statistics:** Top scorers (Orange Cap contenders), leading wicket-takers (Purple Cap contenders), and the most aggressive hitters (fours and sixes).
**Team Statistics:** Season-wise performance and home vs. away win percentages.

# Dataset Information
The analysis is based on two primary datasets:

- **matches.csv** – Contains match-level data, including team names, results, venues, and match specifics.
- **deliveries.csv** – Provides ball-by-ball information for all IPL matches across seasons, including batting, bowling, and delivery outcomes.


# Methodology and Tools

**Data Integration:** Merging matches.csv and deliveries.csv to create a unified dataset.
**Data Visualization:** Using Tableau to design interactive dashboards that allow users to explore various IPL trends effortlessly.

# Key Features of the Dashboard

**Interactive Visualization:** Allows users to apply filters and customize views to gain insights from various perspectives.
**Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyzes performance at the match, player, and team levels.
**Trend Identification:** Highlights critical trends that can help teams optimize their strategies in future IPL seasons.

# Conclusion

 This project takes IPL analysis to the next level by leveraging Tableau to uncover stories hidden within the data, ensuring that stakeholders get a richer and more comprehensive view of the game.
